Project constraints:
- This is a client-only web app.
- No backend, no APIs, no servers.
- Data must be stored locally using IndexedDB.

- The app must be hostable on GitHub Pages.

Technical constraints:
- Use TypeScript.
- Use modern React with functional components and hooks.
- Use Vite as the build tool.
- No Redux unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer simple, explicit logic over abstractions.
- Avoid premature optimisation.

Development process:
- Do not generate large amounts of code without explaining the structure first.
- When making architectural decisions, explain the trade-offs.
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous.
- Keep files small and focused.
